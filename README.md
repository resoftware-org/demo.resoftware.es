## Installation

To install this software, you'll want to clone or download this repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/resoftware-org/demo.resoftware.es.git project_name
```

Next, we can install re:Software with these **4 simple steps**:

### 1. Create a New Database

We'll need to utilize a MySQL database during the installation. For the following stage, you'll need to create a new database and preserve the credentials.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE wave;
CREATE USER 'wave'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'wave_password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON wave.* TO 'wave'@'localhost';
```

### 2. Copy the `.env.example` file

We need to specify our Environment variables for our application. You will see a file named `.env.example`, you will need to duplicate that file and rename it to `.env`.

Then, open up the `.env` file and update your *DB_DATABASE*, *DB_USERNAME*, and *DB_PASSWORD* in the appropriate fields. You will also want to update the *APP_URL* to the URL of your application.

```bash
APP_URL=http://wave.test

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=wave
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=
```

### 3. Add Composer Dependencies

First, you should ensure that your web server has the required PHP extensions installed:

> [Laravel PHP Requirements](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/deployment#server-requirements)

Following that, we'll need to install all composer dependencies through the following command:
```php
composer install
```

### 4. Run Migrations and Seeds

We must migrate our database schema into our database, which we can accomplish by running the following command:
```php
php artisan migrate
```
<br>
Finally, we will need to seed our database with the following command:

```php
php artisan db:seed
```
<br>

ðŸŽ‰ And that's it! You will now be able to visit your URL and see your re:Software application up and running.

## Authentication

The backend can be accessed *only* using user accounts that are assigned the `admin`-role.

The **default admin credentials** are:

- Username: `support@resoftware.es`
- Password: `NotSoSecureAdminPassword`

Please, make sure to edit these *before* you deploy this software in production.
