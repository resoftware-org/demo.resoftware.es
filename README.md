## Demo

View a live [demo here](https://play.resoftware.es), or deploy your own instance to DigitalOcean, by clicking the button below.

<a href="https://cloud.digitalocean.com/apps/new?repo=https://github.com/resoftware-org/demo.resoftware.es/tree/main" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.deploytodo.com/do-btn-blue.svg" width="240" alt="Deploy to DigitalOcean"></a>

## Installation

To install this software, you'll want to clone or download this repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/resoftware-org/demo.resoftware.es.git project_name
```

Next, we can install re:Software with these **4 simple steps**:

### 1. Create a New Database

We'll need to utilize a MySQL database during the installation. For the following stage, you'll need to create a new database and preserve the credentials.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE wave;
CREATE USER 'wave'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'wave_password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON wave.* TO 'wave'@'localhost';
```

### 2. Copy the `.env.example` file

We need to specify our Environment variables for our application. You will see a file named `.env.example`, you will need to duplicate that file and rename it to `.env`.

Then, open up the `.env` file and update your *DB_DATABASE*, *DB_USERNAME*, and *DB_PASSWORD* in the appropriate fields. You will also want to update the *APP_URL* to the URL of your application.

```bash
APP_URL=http://wave.test

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=wave
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=
```

### 3. Add Composer Dependencies

First, you should ensure that your web server has the required PHP extensions installed:

> [Laravel PHP Requirements](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/deployment#server-requirements)

Following that, we'll need to install all composer dependencies through the following command:
```php
composer install
```

### 4. Run Migrations and Seeds

We must migrate our database schema into our database, which we can accomplish by running the following command:
```php
php artisan migrate
```
<br>
Finally, we will need to seed our database with the following command:

```php
php artisan db:seed
```
<br>

ðŸŽ‰ And that's it! You will now be able to visit your URL and see your re:Software application up and running.

## Development

The backend can be accessed *only* using user accounts that are assigned the `admin`-role.

The **default admin credentials** are:

- Username: `support@resoftware.es`
- Password: `NotSoSecureAdminPassword`

Please, make sure to edit these *before* you deploy this software in production.

### Reset database and re-seed

```
php artisan migrate:refresh
php artisan db:seed

# include demo data
php artisan db:seed --class="ReplayDataSeeder"
```

### API Authentication

To perform an authentication operation using the API, you can use **curl**. Execute
the following command to start the authentication and to receive a **Bearer token**
from the API. You will need this access token for subsequent requests to the API.

*Example:*
```
curl -X POST http://demo.resoftware.loc:8000/api/v1/wave/login \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{"email": "demo.david@resoftware.es", "password": "NotSoSecureMentorPassword"}'
```

The response of this command (if you provide correct credentials), should look somewhat
similar to the following:

*Example:*
```
{"access_token":"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJodHRwOi8vZGVtby5yZXNvZnR3YXJlLmxvYzo4MDAwL2FwaS92MS93YXZlL2xvZ2luIiwiaWF0IjoxNjkxMzk3MTg1LCJleHAiOjE2OTE0MDA3ODUsIm5iZiI6MTY5MTM5NzE4NSwianRpIjoiNXIzTEg1bW16b2lZRjlkUSIsInN1YiI6IjYiLCJwcnYiOiIyM2JkNWM4OTQ5ZjYwMGFkYjM5ZTcwMWM0MDA4NzJkYjdhNTk3NmY3In0.oPZMEZr5LKlItnVEE3DwViRjBA99MtANW-Z5qrS_XBQ","token_type":"bearer","expires_in":60}
```

**Subsequent requests to the API must include the access token as a Bearer token in the request.**

### API Requests

Now that you have authenticated using the API, you can also execute API requests calling
specific endpoints, including: `/api/v1/user` and `/api/v1/courses`.

An example request *including a valid access token* looks as follows:

*Example:*
```
curl -X GET http://demo.resoftware.loc:8000/api/v1/courses?term=abc \
     -H 'Authorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJodHRwOi8vZGVtby5yZXNvZnR3YXJlLmxvYzo4MDAwL2FwaS92MS93YXZlL2xvZ2luIiwiaWF0IjoxNjkxMzk3MTg1LCJleHAiOjE2OTE0MDA3ODUsIm5iZiI6MTY5MTM5NzE4NSwianRpIjoiNXIzTEg1bW16b2lZRjlkUSIsInN1YiI6IjYiLCJwcnYiOiIyM2JkNWM4OTQ5ZjYwMGFkYjM5ZTcwMWM0MDA4NzJkYjdhNTk3NmY3In0.oPZMEZr5LKlItnVEE3DwViRjBA99MtANW-Z5qrS_XBQ'
```
