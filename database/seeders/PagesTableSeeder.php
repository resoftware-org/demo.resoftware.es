("re:Software SL", "re:Chain", "re:Software", "Using Blockchain Ltd", “Using Blockchain”, "UBC Digital", “<strong>we</strong>”, “<strong>us</strong>”) provides a suite of technologies to publishers for use on their websites (“<strong>re:Website Tools</strong>” or “<strong>re:Software Tools</strong>”). re:Software Tools provide website owners with the capability to engage users of their websites with social networks and other destinations via a browser plug-in or website plug-in. With re:Software Tools, publishers can (i) enable users to share, follow, view, recommend and interact with the publisher’s content, and (ii) collect information from those users as a result of their visit. The re:Software Tools are available for download through re:Software or through selected third party sites.</p><p>This Privacy Policy applies to the processing of personal information by re:Software S.L. of:</p><ul class="obullets"><li>visitors and users of the various re:Software S.L. sites, including our websites on <a href="https://resoftware.es">resoftware.es</a>, <a href="https://dings.app">dings.app</a>, <a href="https://evias.be">evi.as</a>, <a href="https://evi.as">evi.as</a>, <a href="https://ubc.digital">ubc.digital</a>, <a href="https://milestudios.es">milestudios.es</a>, <a href="https://milrecetas.es">milrecetas.es</a> computer or mobile software applications and our social media pages that link to this Privacy Policy (collectively referred to as the "<strong>Software products</strong>");</li><li>attendees of re:Software S.L.-sponsored events;</li><li>customers and prospective customers and their representatives;</li><li>subscribers to UBC Digital Magazine; and</li><li>suppliers and business partners and their representatives.</li></ul><p>When interacting with our websites, you also have the ability to link or connect with non-re:Software S.L. websites, services, social networks, applications or other features. Enabling these features will lead to other parties than re:Software S.L. processing information about you. re:Software S.L. does not have any control over these features of other parties. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of these parties before using these features. This re:Software Privacy Policy (also referred to as the “<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>”) informs consumers about the collection, use, sharing, and selling (collectively referred to as “<strong>processing</strong>” or “<strong>process</strong>”) of your personal information in connection with re:Software S.L.\'s provision of the re:Software Tools and Software products. It also explains the privacy rights you have in relation to these processing activities. When you interact with a website on which a publisher has installed re:Software Tools, your direct interactions are primarily with that publisher. In our <a href="/p/terms-of-service">re:Software Terms of Service</a> with the publisher, we require that the publisher informs you directly of how it collects and uses your personal information in this context, and gets your consent where appropriate. We may then also receive information about you via your interactions with the publisher’s re:Software Tools, so this Privacy Policy informs you how we process that personal information. This Privacy Policy was last updated on June 25, 2020. However, the Privacy Policy can change over time, for example to meet changing business or legal requirements. The most up-to-date version can be found on this <a href="/privacy">website</a>. In case there is an important change that we want to highlight to you, we will also inform you in another appropriate way (for example, via a pop-up notice or statement of changes on our website).</p>

Upon opting out, we will place an opt-out Cookie on your device. The opt-out Cookie tells the re:Software Tools not to include information from that device in re:Software Data.</li><li><strong>AdTech Industry Opt-out.</strong> You may also opt out of third party sharing or selling by the re:Software Cloud by using the opt-out tools provided by the following industry groups:<ul class="obullets"><li>Digital Advertising Alliance (‘DAA’): <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a></li><li>Network Advertising Initiative (‘NAI’): <a href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org/">http://optout.networkadvertising.org</a></li><li>European Interactive Digital Adverting Alliance (‘EDAA’): <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/">http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/</a> and <a href="http://www.edaa.eu/">http://www.edaa.eu/</a></li></ul></li><li><strong>Do Not Track.</strong> re:Software S.L. honors “Do Not Track” browser settings, meaning we will not track your browser for marketing purposes while you have “Do Not Track” turned on in your browser settings.</li></ul><p>Please note that if you opt out using the first two opt out tools, you may still temporarily receive marketing due to marketing campaigns already underway. However, you will be opted-out of all future marketing campaigns that use the re:Software Data. Also note that the first two opt out tools are currently cookie-based and prevent re:Software S.L. from using, sharing, or selling your personal information for interest-based advertising on the browser on which they are installed. As a result, the opt out will only function if your browser is set to accept third-party cookies and may not function where cookies are sometimes automatically disabled or removed (e.g., certain mobile devices and operating systems). If you delete cookies, change your browser settings, switch browsers or computers, or use another operating system, you will need to opt out again. re:Software S.L. does not use persistent, unique identifiers to revive a previously opted-out profile or deleted cookie. <strong>Access personal information</strong> In order to exercise your right to access your online information, you can use the <a href="https://resoftware/privacy-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">re:Software Data Registry</a> (“<strong>Registry</strong>”) to view the online segments re:Software S.L. has associated with your device. By accessing this Registry, you can view the types of third-party interest segments that are shared with or sold to re:Software S.L. customers. Please note that the interest segments you see within the Registry is information about you from the profile associated with the specific browser, computer or device that you are using to visit the Registry. You may see different segments when viewing the Registry from a different browser, computer or device. We therefore recommend using different browsers and devices when accessing the Registry. <strong>Delete personal information</strong> You can erase or delete the re:Software Data re:Software S.L. is processing about your device or remove segments in the <a href="https://resoftware.es/privacy-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Registry</a> by opting out of re:Software S.L. services using the <a href="https://resoftware.es/opt-out-inquiry" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">opt-out tool</a>.</p>

                    <h2>5. Fees, Payment, and Renewal</h2><h3>a. re:Software S.L. and MilEstudios.es Fees</h3><strong>Fees for Paid Services.</strong> Some of our Services are offered for a fee, such as re:Software Tools, YourDLT Tools, YourDLT plans, MilEstudios.es plans, MilEstudios.es plans and some Ecommerce Services (collectively, “<strong>Paid Services</strong>”). By using a Paid Service, you agree to pay the specified fees (for example, <a href="https://milestudios.es/#pricing">MilEstudios.es fees</a>, and fees associated with specific features, such as <a href="https://support.resoftware.es/domains/domain-pricing-and-available-tlds/">domain name registration and renewal</a>). Depending on the Paid Service, there may be one-time fees, recurring fees, or revenue-based fees. For recurring fees, we’ll bill or charge you for in regular automatically-renewing intervals (such as monthly, annually, or biennially), on a pre-pay basis until you cancel, which you can do at any time by contacting the relevant support team. For revenue-based fees — such as <a href="https://support.resoftware.es/recurring-payments-button/#related-fees">fees for Recurring Payments</a> for your website’s subscriptions — you pay us a percentage of the revenue your website generates. Revenue-based fees are ongoing. <strong>Taxes.</strong> To the extent permitted by law, or unless explicitly stated otherwise, all fees are exclusive of applicable federal, provincial, state, local or other governmental sales, goods and services, harmonized or other taxes, fees, or charges now in force or enacted in the future (“<strong>Taxes</strong>”). You are responsible for payment of all applicable Taxes relating to your use of our Services, your payments, or your purchases. If we are obligated to pay or collect Taxes on the Fees you’ve paid or will pay, you are responsible for such Taxes, and we may collect payment for such Taxes. <strong>Payment.</strong> If your payment fails or if Paid Services are otherwise not paid for or paid for on time, we may immediately cancel or revoke your access to the Paid Services. If you contact your bank or credit card company to decline or reverse the charge of fees for Paid Services, we may revoke your access to our Services in general. <strong>Automatic Renewal.</strong> To ensure uninterrupted service, recurring Paid Services are automatically renewed. This means that unless you cancel a Paid Service before the end of the applicable subscription period, it will automatically renew, and you authorize us to invoice you or use any payment mechanism we have on record for you to collect the then-applicable subscription fee (as well as any Taxes). By default, your Paid Services will be renewed for the same interval of time as your original subscription period. For example, if you purchase a MilEstudios.es annual plan, you will be charged each year for the following 12-month period. We may charge your account up to one month before the end of the subscription period. It is your responsibility to make sure you are checking your email (including any spam or other filters) in order to receive any reminder email we send to you in advance of renewal. The date for the automatic renewal is determined automatically based on the date of the original purchase and cannot be changed. You can view your renewal date for MilEstudios.es Paid Services by visiting your <a href="https://resoftware.es/me/purchases">Manage Purchases page</a>. For more information about how MilEstudios.es subscriptions work, please see our <a href="https://support.resoftware.es/manage-purchases/">Manage Purchases, Renewals &amp; Cancellations support page</a>. <strong>Cancelling Automatic Renewal.</strong> You can manage and cancel your Paid Services at the respective Service’s site. For example, you can manage all of your MilEstudios.es plans through your MilEstudios.es <a href="https://resoftware.es/me/purchases">Manage Purchases page</a>. To cancel a MilEstudios.es plan, go to your <a href="https://resoftware.es/me/purchases">Manage Purchases page</a>, click on the plan you wish to cancel, then follow the instructions to “cancel the subscription.” You must repeat this process for each subscription you wish to cancel. <strong>Fee Changes.</strong> We may change our fees at any time, or start charging fees for Services that were previously free. When applicable, we may give you advance notice of the fee changes. If you don’t agree with the fee changes, you must cancel your Paid Service. <b>No-Show Policy. </b>We may have a “no-show policy” for some Paid Services (for example, for our <a href="https://support.resoftware.es/quick-start-support/#purchasing-a-session">Quick Start sessions</a>), which means that if you fail to show up or are late for a scheduled session, we may withhold the Service without a refund. <strong>Refunds.</strong> While you may cancel a Paid Service at any time, refunds are issued in our sole discretion, unless otherwise required by applicable law.
                    <h3>b. Fees Collected by Website Owners</h3><strong>Fees Paid to Websites or Website Owners.</strong> Website owners may choose to sell items (goods, content, services, etc.), offer subscriptions for their websites at specific price points and intervals, or simply collect payments. Please note that we are not involved in a website’s subscription details, or a website’s store operations (including the quality, timing, pricing, or legality of what may or may not be included in exchange for payment, or any goods or services purchased). If you purchase items or subscriptions from a website, your purchase is directly from the website owner, who is solely responsible for the items sold. Please contact the website owner if you have any questions or complaints. <strong>Automatic Renewal.</strong> Any recurring payments you make to a website owner (such as a <a href="https://support.resoftware.es/recurring-payments/">website subscription</a>) are automatically renewed. This means that unless you cancel your website subscription before the end of the applicable renewal period, it will automatically renew. Your recurring payments will be renewed for the same interval of time as your original subscription period. For example, for an annual renewal schedule for your website subscription, you will be charged each year. You can view your renewal date by visiting your <a href="https://resoftware.es/me/purchases/other">Other Sites page</a>. <strong>Cancelling Automatic Renewal of Website Subscriptions.</strong> You can manage and cancel your website subscriptions at your <a href="https://resoftware.es/me/purchases/other">Other Sites page</a>. Click on the automatically renewing payment you wish to cancel, then follow the instructions to cancel. You must repeat this process for each website subscription you wish to cancel. <strong>Refunds.</strong> We are not responsible for refunds for fees paid to a website owner because those transactions are between website owners and their users. If you would like to request a refund for any fees paid to a website or website owner, please contact the website owner. If you have a complaint regarding a website owner, you can <a href="https://resoftware.es/abuse/">contact us</a>.
